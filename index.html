                    <p> Hey there! My name is Colton Johnson and I am a Chapel Hill local. After moving as a youth to North Carolina from Petaluma California I have lived here ever since. I am fortunate to have been blessed with wonderful friends and family in the area. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I spent my late teen years in Boone North Carolina, and after attending classes at the local community college I returned to the Chapel Hill area to finish an Associates in Science. At Allamance Community College I focused on chemistry and mathematics.
                    </p>  
                    <br>  
                    <p>  During the finishing months of my humble degree I was hired on by Holmes Oil Company, where I served for several years as a marketing analyst and pricebbok coordinator. Realizing the convenience store industry was not a good fit for me I decided to pursue a (surprisingly) more lucrative career in the food service industry. I went on to work as an independent contractor for Takeout Central, a local third party food delivery service. I am currently attending UNC's Coding Bootcamp in the hopes of pursuing a new career in web development and look forward to the challenges ahead.
